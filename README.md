# COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND VISUALIZATION 
- Course Code : BCG402
- Credits : 4

## Course objectives:
* Understand concepts of Computer Graphics along with its applications
* Exploring mathematics for 2D and 3D graphics along with OpenGL API’s
* Use of Computer graphics in animation and GUIdesign.
* Demonstrate Geometric transformations, viewing on both 2D and 3D objects
* Infer the representation of curves, surfaces, Color and Illumination models

## Lab Experiments

1. Develop OpenGL program to draw a lineusing Bresenham’s algorithm for all types of slopes. 

2. Develop OpenGL program to create and rotate a triangle about the origin and a fixed point.

3. Develop a OpenGL program to implement to recursively subdivide a tetrahedron to form 3D sierpinski gasket. The number of recursive steps is to be specified by the user.

4. Develop a menu driven program to animate the polygon using 3D geometric transformations.

5. Develop a OpenGL program to Clip 2D lines using Cohen-Sutherland algorithm.

6. Develop a OpenGL program to Spin 3D sierpinski gasket using OpenGL transformation matrices.

7. Develop a OpenGL program to draw a simple shaded scene consisting of a tea pot on a table. Define
suitably the position and properties of the light source along with the properties of the surfaces of the
solid object used in the scene.

8. Develop a OpenGL program to draw a color cube and allow the user to move the camera suitably to
experiment with perspective viewing.

9. Develop a OpenGL program to draw a simple scene containing few 3D objects and provide day and night
effect. Define suitably the position and properties of the light source used in the scene.
